# there are primitive pythagorean triplets and their multiples
# (3,4,5) and (5,12,13) are primitive
# but (6,8,10) are not

# there is a formula for generating triplets (does not generate all of them)
# a = ( m2 â€“ n2 ) 
# b = (2 m n)
# c = ( m2 + n2 )

# let's hope it is the case in this problem. 
# therefore we have
# a+b+c = 2m^2 + 2mn
