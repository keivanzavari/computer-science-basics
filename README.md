## Computer science basics

This repository was initially created to host the solutions to some small computer science/math problems.
It gradually grew to something slightly bigger.

If you have followed any *Introduction to Algorithms* type of course such as the famous [MIT course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/), you come across many of the problems hosted here.

Some others are problems that I have simply found interesting or have come across during my path to understanding basics of computer science, mathematics & algorithms.
